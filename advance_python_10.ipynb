        "#### Q1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?\n",
        "Ans: `__getattribute__` is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. `__getattr__` is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by `__getattribute__`, but for this `__getattribute__` and `__getattr__` both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, `__getattr__` returns a default value. So key difference is that `__getattr__` is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
