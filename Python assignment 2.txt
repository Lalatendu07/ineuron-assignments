1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type?How do you write them?
Ans. The two values of Boolean data type are 'True' and 'False'.To declare a boolean variable, we use the keyword bool. Ex:- print('value is',bool(arg)).

2.What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans.The three different types of boolean operators are "and","or" and "not".

3.Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables(i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate).
Ans. 
      OPERATOR       WHAT IT MEANS                  EXAMPLE
        and   -----true if both are true            x and y
        or    -----true if at least one is true     x or y
        not   -----true only if false               not x

4.What are the values of the following expressions?
Ans.(5>4)and(3==5)                      output=False
    not(5>4)                            output=False
    (5>4)or(3==5)                       output=True
    not((5>4)or(3==5))                  output=False
    (True and True)and(True==False)     output=False
    (not False)or(not True)             output=True

5.What are the six comparison operators?
Ans.The six comparison operators are less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ), equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans.The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not.For assignment of value into a variable "=" is used, like this x = 7. And for checking whether the two operands are equal or not "==" is used, like this 1==2.

7.Identify the three blocks in this code:
Ans.1st block---spam=0
    2nd block---if spam==10:
                     print('eggs')
    3rd block---if spam>5:
                     print('bacon')
                 else:
                     print('ham')
                     print('spam')
                     print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans.  print('enter a number')
      spam=int(input())
      if spam == 1:
            print('Hello')
      elif spam == 2:
            print('Howdy')
      else:
            print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you'll press?
Ans.CTRL + C , to stop the endless loop.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans. BREAK
    -Break statement stops the entire process of the loop.
    -It also terminates the remaining iterations.

     CONTINUE
    -Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop.
    -Continue doesn't terminate the next iterations.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans.No difference.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans. -for loop
      for i in range(1 , 11):
          print(i)
      
     -while loop
      i=1
      while i<=10:
         print(i)
         i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans. After importing spam we can call bacon() function by using a dot(.) operator along with the module name. Like this, spam.bacon().
