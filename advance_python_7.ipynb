        "#### Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
        "Ans: try statement is used for exception handling in python. It consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime, if code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it will be reverted to the default except block. In short try and except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions.\n"

Whereas the code inside except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceeding __try__ block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whereas the code enters the __else__ block if and only if the try clause does not raise an exception. The code in the __finally__ block will execute irrespective of exception."

This statement takes a boolean condition output of which is True, Further Program Executes. If output of assert statement is False, it raises an Assertion Error."

When we use a __with__ statement for file reading, there is no need for programmer to explicitly takecare of activities like resource deallocation and file closing by using file.close() method. __with__ statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources, this avoids triggering of exceptions if file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution.\n",
