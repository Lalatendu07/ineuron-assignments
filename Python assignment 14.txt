1. What does RGBA stand for?
Ans. RGBA stands for Red-Green-Blue-Alpha.

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
Ans.By using ImageColor.getcolor() ,it gives RGBA value of any image.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
Ans. A box tuple is a tuple value of four integers: the left-edge x-coordinate, the top-edge y-coordinate,the width, and the height, respectively.The box tuple submodule provides read-only access for the tuple userdata type. It allows, for a single tuple: selective retrieval of the field contents, retrieval of information about size, iteration over all the fields, and conversion to a Lua table.

4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?
Ans.By using .width and .height property of Image we can get the height and width of the image object.
    eg:-from PIL import Image
        pic = Image.open('Pic.jpg')
        print(f'Width, Height = {pic.width},{pic.height}')

5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
Ans. crop() method.
     eg:-from PIL import Image
         img = Image.open('Pic.jpg')
         new_img = img.crop((0,50,50,50))

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
Ans.We can use the .save() function to save image file.
    eg:-from PIL import Image
        pic = Image.open('pic.jpg')
        pic.save('pic2.jpg')

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
Ans. ImageDraw module.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?
Ans. ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle().They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function.
