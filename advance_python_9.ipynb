Text mode files also support universal end-of-line translation, and encoding specification arguments.\n",

Binary-mode files also accept a bytearray object for the content to be written to the file."

The difference between ASCII and Unicode is that ASCII represents lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0â€“9) and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc. Mathematical symbols, historical scripts, emoji covering a wide range of characters than ASCII."

        "Ans: Python 3 stores strings as Unicode by default whereas Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. Unicode strings are more versatile than ASCII strings, which are the Python 3.X default, as they can store letters from foreign languages as well as emoji and the standard Roman letters and numerals."
