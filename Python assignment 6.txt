1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
Ans.In python strings, backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character.
It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab,"\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return.

2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?
Ans.Escape character n stands for newline(\n) and t stands for tab(\t).

3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?
Ans.Use the syntax r"\" to treat backslash (\) as a literal character, and not as an escape character.

 Ex:-raw_text = r"abc\123"
     print(raw_text)
     OUTPUT:-abc\123

4.The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?
Ans. The single quote in Howl's is fine because we have used double quotes to mark the beginning and end of the string.

5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?
Ans. We can print strings without adding a new line with end = <character> , which <character> is the character that will be used to separate the lines.
